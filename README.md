This repository is a collection of Tableau dashboards I’ve built to explore data stories, solve analytical problems, and practice visualization techniques. Each workbook reflects a different use case, from foundational charting and layout experiments to more advanced, interactive dashboards built around real-world scenarios. The data comes from public sources and Excel files, and I’ve used Tableau features like calculated fields, parameters, filters, and dashboard actions to bring the visuals to life. These dashboards represent both my learning process and my approach to clean, insightful data storytelling. You can view many of these dashboards live on my Tableau Public profile here: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/hruthika.reddy.nannuri/vizzes
